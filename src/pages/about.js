          Many people have supported me, in different ways, during the work with
          the thesis. <br />
          Iâ€™d like to thank my guide Mr.Lokendra pal & HOD Dr. Naveen
          Hemrajani for their kind and active support and valuable guidance
          during the work process. My family has as always offered me their
          unconditional support, thank you! I have taken efforts in the Minor
          Project. However, it would not have been possible without the kind
          support and many individuals and organizations. I would like to extend
          my sincere thanks to each and every member related to JECRC
          University.
